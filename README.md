🐾 Project Description

20 Questions: Animal Edition is a simple Java console game where the computer tries to guess the animal you're thinking of using yes/no questions. The program uses a decision tree structure with if statements to narrow down the possibilities and make a guess based on the user’s responses.

Key Features:
- Interactive yes/no questioning using the Scanner class
- Basic decision logic with nested if statements
- Simple branching to guess between animals like dog, elephant, or bird
- Beginner-friendly code structure and logic

🎯 Who It's For

This project is ideal for:
- Beginner Java programmers learning:
  - Input handling with Scanner
  - Conditional logic (if/else)
  - Nested decision-making structures
- Students in introductory programming or computer science classes
- Teachers looking for a fun, logic-based assignment that introduces control flow
- Anyone interested in creating simple games or branching logic programs as a foundation for more complex decision trees or AI-style games
